# Document

## Project Overview

Go document model library. Package: `digital.vasic.document/pkg/document`.

## Build Commands

```bash
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./... -count=1
```

## Architecture

- `document.go` - Document struct, New(), Filename(), change tracking, file ops, JSON serialization
- `detector.go` - DetectByExtension(), DetectByContent(), GetAllExtensions()

## Key Patterns

- 18 format constants matching Document-KMP
- Document equality uses Path + Title + Format
- ModTime/TouchTime excluded from JSON via `json:"-"`

## Definition of Done

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done" requires pasted
terminal output from a real run of the real system, produced in the same session as
the change. Coverage and passing suites measure the LLM's model of the product, not
the product.

1. **No self-certification.** *Verified, tested, working, complete, fixed, passing*
   are forbidden in commits, PRs, and agent replies without accompanying pasted
   output from a same-session real-system run.
2. **Demo before code.** Every task begins with the runnable acceptance demo below.
3. **Real system.** Demos run against real artifacts — built binaries, live
   databases, instrumented devices — not mocks/stubs/in-memory fakes.
4. **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `it.skip` without a trailing
   `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` annotation fails `make ci-validate-all`.
5. **Contract tests on every seam.** Any change touching a module↔module boundary
   runs one roundtrip test asserting the wire format on both sides.
6. **Evidence in the PR.** PR body contains a fenced `## Demo` block with exact
   command(s) + output.

### Acceptance demo for this module

```bash
# TODO — replace with a 10-line real-system demo. See examples in
# HelixAgent/docs/development/dod-dropin/templates/CLAUDE_md_clause.md
```
